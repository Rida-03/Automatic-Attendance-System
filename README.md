Summary:
A Face Recognition Based Attendance System is a biometric technology application that automates the process of recording attendance using facial features. It replaces traditional methods such as manual sign-in or card swipes with a camera and face recognition software. This system improves efficiency, reduces fraud (e.g., buddy punching), and ensures accurate time tracking.
