Summary:
A Face Recognition Based Attendance System is a biometric technology application that automates the process of recording attendance using facial features. It replaces traditional methods such as manual sign-in or card swipes with a camera and face recognition software. This system improves efficiency, reduces fraud (e.g., buddy punching), and ensures accurate time tracking.

Working of the System
Image Capture:
A camera captures real-time images or video of individuals as they enter the premises or a classroom.

Face Detection:
The system uses a face detection algorithm (like Haar Cascade) to locate faces within the captured frames.

Face Recognition:
Facial features are extracted and compared with pre-stored images in the database using algorithms

Authentication:
If the face matches an existing entry in the database, the system marks attendance for that individual with a timestamp.

Data Storage:
Attendance records are stored in a database and confirmation mail is sent

Key Technologies Used:
CV2 and Imagetk (for face detection)

Machine Learning / Deep Learning (for recognition)

Python
